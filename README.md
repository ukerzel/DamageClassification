# Damage Classification in Dual Phase Steels

In this repository, we investigate the behaviour of steel under stress. As (tensile) stress is applied to a sample, different type of damage affect the microstructure. In particular, we investigate:
- Martensite Cracking
- Notch Effect
- Interface Decohesion

Additionally, we need to remove damage sites related from inclusion of foreign particles that have been embedded during the manufacturing process.
Furthermore, we need to consider imaging artefacts such as shadows that are cast when the beam of an electron microscope affects the way the image is recorded due to the three-dimensional structure of the sample in the microscope.

Starting point from the investigation is a panoramic image taken from a dual phase steel specimen in an electron microscope.
